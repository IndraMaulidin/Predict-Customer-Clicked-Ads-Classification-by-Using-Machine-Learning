# Predict-Customer-Clicked-Ads-Classification-by-Using-Machine-Learning
Mini Project : Predict Customer Clicked Ads Classification by Using Machine Learning from Rakamin Academy

## Overview
A company in Indonesia wants to know the effectiveness of an advertisement that they display, this is important for the company to be able to find out how much the advertising has been marketed so that it can attract customers to see the advertisement.
By processing historical advertisement data and finding insights and patterns that occur, it can help companies determine marketing targets. The focus of this case is to create a machine learning classification model that functions to determine the right target customers.

## Customer Type and Behaviour Analysis on Advertisement
In a data analysis, the first thing that must be done is to understand the pattern of the data itself, where the problem that is the target of analysis can be related to its variables. A company engaged in digital marketing wants to know the pattern of customers when using the internet and whether the duration of the customer's stay on a website will affect the company's marketing, this of course will calculate the behavior patterns of customers who click on the advertisements presented. Companies also want to know what age intervals can be targeted marketing, namely what age range will visit the ad. At this stage, the analysis can use bivariate and multivariate analysis as well as the correlation between these variables, so that they can be visualized properly.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The next stage in data analysis is data cleaning and preprocessing, this is done to find out whether the data that occurs still has missing values, duplicated or has an incorrect data type. The data team is required to clean up the data, then the clean data can be separated into feature data and target data, so that when doing modeling, machine learning can learn and predict, make sure the feature data has been encoded first.

## Data Modeling
Data Modeling becomes a crucial part in predicting an analysis, at this stage, the data team uses several machine learning model algorithms in making modeling, such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, and or gradient boost, so they can see the differences in algorithms in predict it. It is suggested that the data team can do two experiments of the algorithm, where the data in the first experiment is not normalized/standardized, and the second is the reverse. The results of the model can be shown by using the evaluation of the confusion matrix and what important features are the determinants of the marketing.

## Business Recomendation and Simulation
The final stage of analyzing the data is business recommendations and simulations that will be presented and understood by stakeholders, so that marketing decisions can reduce the risk of failure and reduce costs in marketing. The data team needs to make recommendations based on the results of the machine learning model, in the form of important features and presentations of success in targeting customers who will see these ads. and create simulations that can show the difference between marketing without and using machine learning models.
